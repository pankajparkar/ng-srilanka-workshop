3.  Observable - What is Observable? - Promises steriods - 
4.  Routing and Resolve - Add pages and their respective route. - Resolve with timer
5.  Component Communication(Input, Event) and Share data between components - Demonstration of using service all over

8.  What is CD? and Common mistakes with change detection - Show 2 slides of Change detection - And then link to video. 
9.  Pipe and its optimization - No
10. Modularization - Explaination and style guide - FeatureModule, SharedModule, CoreModule, etc.

Will end with take away and extensions that can be performed by the attendees.

Note: Each of above step code will be a separate branch like step-1, step-2, step-3, etc. If someone does not able to complete their task within a time, they can checkout the next step branch to proceed.
